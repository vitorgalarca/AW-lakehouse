Building a Real-Time Data Engineering Project with Azure


Overall Goal: Learn how to use various Azure resources to build a complete end-to-end data engineering project for migrating and analyzing on-premise data.

 
Target Audience: Beginner to intermediate data engineers, data analysts interested in cloud-based data projects.

 
Prerequisites: Basic understanding of data engineering concepts, optional familiarity with Azure tools.

 
Lesson Structure:

 
Part 1: Introduction

 
Welcome and project overview

Use case: Migrating on-premise SQL Server data to cloud and building analytics reports

Importance of the project for resume and interviews

 
Part 2: Tools and Architecture

 
List and explanation of Azure resources used:

Azure Data Factory (ADF)

Azure Synapse Analytics

Azure Databricks

Azure Data Lake Gen 2

Azure Active Directory

Azure Key Vault

Power BI

Introduction to "Lakehouse architecture" with bronze, silver, and gold data layers


Part 3: Data Ingestion

 
Using ADF to connect to on-premise SQL Server and copy data tables

Storing data in Azure Data Lake Gen 2

 
Part 4: Data Transformation

 
Azure Databricks for data transformation tasks

Bronze layer: Raw data copy

Silver layer: Basic transformations (data types, etc.)

Gold layer: Final curated data

 
Part 5: Data Loading and Reporting

 
Loading gold layer data into Azure Synapse Analytics (similar to on-premise structure)

Using Power BI to create reports and visualizations on Synapse Analytics data

 
Part 6: Automation and Testing

Setting up pipelines to automate data flow and updates

End-to-end pipeline testing

Additional Notes:

 
The instructor mentions separate playlists for specific tools like ADF, which viewers can refer to for deeper understanding.

Each part of the project will be covered in detail in separate videos.



Benefits of Watching:

Gain practical experience building a real-world data engineering project with Azure.

Learn different Azure tools and their roles in data pipelines.

Understand the concept of Lakehouse architecture for data management.

Improve resume and interview skills for data engineering roles.

 
I hope this summary provides a clear and structured roadmap for the video lesson!
